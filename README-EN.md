```

## Usage

### Run Development Server

```bash
php artisan serve
```

### Access the Application

The user interface is available at:
```
http://localhost:8000/quotes-ui
```

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/quotes` - Get all quotes
- `GET /api/quotes/random` - Get a random quote
- `GET /api/quotes/{id}` - Get a quote by ID
- `POST /api/quotes/clear-cache` - Clear server cache

## Main Features

- **Vue.js User Interface**: Modern interface for managing quotes.
- **Caching**: Caching system to improve performance.
- **Rate Limiting**: Rate limitation to protect the API.
- **Debug Panel**: Includes tools for debugging and testing.

## Package Development

If you want to modify the package directly:

```bash
cd packages/quotes-package
npm install
npm run build
```

After compiling the package assets:

```bash
cd ../..
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=quotes-assets
```

## Important Considerations

1. **Component Duplication**: There are currently two versions of the `QuotesApp.vue` component:
   - In `resources/js/vendor/quotes-package/components/QuotesApp.vue` (published)
   - In `packages/quotes-package/resources/js/components/QuotesApp.vue` (original)

   It's important to keep both versions synchronized or decide which one to use.

2. **Vite and Compilation**: The project uses Vite to compile assets. Make sure that:
   - The `vite.config.js` file includes the correct entries
   - The `@vite` directives in the views point to the correct files

3. **Configuration**: The package configuration can be customized by editing `config/quotes.php`.

4. **Development vs. Production**: For development, you can use uncompiled assets. For production, make sure to compile the assets.

5. **The main branch of the repository is the `main` branch.**
6. **To contribute to the project, create a branch from `main` and submit a Pull Request.**

## Troubleshooting

- **Vite Manifest Error**: If a "Vite manifest not found" error appears, make sure that:
  - You have run `npm run build`
  - You have published the assets with `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=quotes-assets`
  - The path in the `@vite` directive is correct

- **Blank Page**: Check for errors in the browser console (F12) and make sure that JavaScript files are loading correctly.

### Note on package structure

The package uses a specific Vite configuration:
- `public/`: Directory where compiled files are generated
- `static/`: Directory for static files that are copied directly without processing

This separation avoids Vite warnings about matching directories and ensures that compilation works correctly.

## Testing

The package includes unit and feature tests to verify its correct operation.

### Run all tests

```bash
cd packages/quotes-package
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

### Run tests by category

```bash
# Unit tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite Unit

# Feature tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite Feature
```

### Run tests by file

```bash
# API service tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/QuotesApiServiceTest.php

# Detailed API route tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Feature/QuotesApiRoutesTest.php

# Basic API route tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Feature/QuotesApiBasicRoutesTest.php
```

### Purpose of each test file

- **QuotesApiServiceTest.php**: Unit tests that verify the correct functioning of the service that communicates with the external API. Checks data retrieval, cache handling, and query optimization.

- **QuotesApiRoutesTest.php**: Detailed feature tests that verify the complete functioning of the API endpoints, including headers, JSON response content, cache management, and rate limits.

- **QuotesApiBasicRoutesTest.php**: Basic tests that verify the fundamental response structure of the API endpoints. These are simpler tests focused on ensuring that the response structure is correct.

# ðŸš€ TESTING GUIDE IN A NEW PROJECT ðŸš€

If you want to test this package in a clean Laravel project, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a new Laravel project

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel test-quotes
cd test-quotes
```

### 2. Configure the local package repository

Create the directory structure for the package:
```bash
mkdir -p packages/quotes-package
```

Clone or copy this repository into that folder:
```bash
# Option 1: Clone (recommended)
git clone https://github.com/your-username/quotes-package.git packages/quotes-package

# Option 2: Copy from an existing location
# xcopy /source/path/quotes-package packages/quotes-package /E /H /C /I
```

### 3. Configure composer.json to use the local repository

Edit your project's `composer.json` file and add:
```json
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "path",
        "url": "./packages/quotes-package"
    }
]
```

### 4. Install the package

```bash
composer require quotes-package/quotes
```

### 5. Publish configuration and assets

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=quotes-config
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=quotes-assets
```

### 6. Start the server and test

```bash
php artisan serve
```

### 7. Access the different functionalities

- **API Endpoints**: 
  - http://localhost:8000/api/quotes
  - http://localhost:8000/api/quotes/random
  - http://localhost:8000/api/quotes/1

- **User interface**:
  - http://localhost:8000/quotes-ui

This should display both the functional API and the fully operational Vue.js user interface.
